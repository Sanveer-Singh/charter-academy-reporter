# Optimized Cursor Rules Documentation

## Overview
This directory contains optimized rule files for the bug-fix workflow system. Rules have been consolidated and optimized for surgical @subsection injection to reduce token overhead and improve context management.

## Optimization Summary

### âœ… What Was Optimized
1. **Token Reduction**: Eliminated redundant content across rule files
2. **Surgical Injection**: Implemented @subsection references for precise rule loading
3. **Rule Consolidation**: Combined related rules into logical groups
4. **Context Prioritization**: Streamlined workflow for better context carryover
5. **Unit of Work Removal**: Eliminated unnecessary complexity for bug-fix workflow

### ðŸ“Š Token Efficiency Improvements
- **Before**: ~15KB workflow + ~50KB individual rules = ~65KB total
- **After**: ~5KB workflow + ~15KB consolidated rules = ~20KB total
- **Savings**: ~70% reduction in token overhead

## Core Files

## Surgical Rule Injection

### Phase-Specific Loading
Instead of loading entire rule files, use @subsection references:

```markdown
# Analysis Phase
Load: @consolidated-rules.mdc#Analysis Phase
Reference: @project-context.mdc#User Roles

# Planning Phase  
Load: @consolidated-rules.mdc#Planning Phase
Reference: @solid-architecture.mdc#SOLID Principles

# Implementation Phase
Load: @consolidated-rules.mdc#Implementation Phase
Reference: @implementation-rules.mdc#Coding Standards
```

### Context-Dependent Rules
Load only what's needed based on bug type:

```markdown
# UI Bug Fix
Load: @consolidated-rules.mdc#UI/UX Changes
Reference: @ux-guidelines.mdc#Design Principles

# Database Bug Fix
Load: @consolidated-rules.mdc#Database Changes
Reference: @data-db.mdc#Entity Framework

# Security Bug Fix
Load: @consolidated-rules.mdc#Security & Compliance
Reference: @security-rules.mdc#OWASP Top 10
```

## Rule Structure

### Consolidated Rules (@consolidated-rules.mdc)
**Contains**:
- Core standards (Security, Architecture, Code Quality)
- Phase-specific requirements (Analysis, Planning, Implementation, QA, Review)
- Context-dependent rules (UI/UX, Database, Performance)
- Surgical injection examples

**Benefits**:
- Single source of truth for most rules
- Reduced file switching
- Better context retention
- Faster rule loading

### Individual Rule Files
**Kept for**:
- Detailed technical standards
- Specific compliance requirements
- Extended documentation
- Reference when needed

**Load only when**:
- Deep technical detail required
- Specific compliance verification needed
- Extended guidance necessary

## Workflow Selection Guide

### When to Use Bug Fix Workflow
- User reports broken functionality
- Existing feature not working as expected
- Performance degradation
- Security vulnerabilities
- Visual/UI inconsistencies

### When to Use Feature Development Workflow
- New functionality requested
- User stories provided
- Enhancement to existing features
- Multiple related requirements
- "As a user, I want..." format

## Migration Guide

### From Old Structure
1. **Replace**: Individual rule loading with @consolidated-rules.mdc
2. **Use**: @subsection references for specific requirements
3. **Load**: Context-dependent rules only when needed
4. **Reference**: @project-context.mdc for project-specific context

### Best Practices
1. **Always start** with appropriate workflow (@bug-fix-workflow.mdc or @feature-development-workflow.mdc)
2. **Load phase rules** from consolidated files or specific rule files
3. **Reference subsections** for specific requirements
4. **Load individual rules** only when deep detail needed
5. **Use @subsection injection** for surgical rule loading
6. **Follow test-first approach** for feature development

## Key Differences: Bug Fix vs Feature Development

### Bug Fix Workflow
- **Focus**: Fix broken functionality
- **Approach**: Analyze â†’ Plan â†’ Fix â†’ Verify
- **Testing**: Regression and fix verification
- **Scope**: Narrow, targeted changes
- **Documentation**: Analysis and fix documentation

### Feature Development Workflow
- **Focus**: Build new functionality
- **Approach**: Analyze â†’ Test-First Plan â†’ TDD Implementation â†’ QA
- **Testing**: Test-driven development from the start
- **Scope**: Broader, multi-component changes
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive feature documentation

## Maintenance Notes

- All rule files now use consistent @subsection referencing
- Consolidated rules provide single source of truth for bug fixes
- Feature workflow emphasizes test-first development
- Surgical injection enables precise rule loading
- Token overhead reduced by ~70%
- Context management improved through better rule organization
- Both workflows support state management and handoffs

**Remember**: 
- Use @subsection references for surgical rule injection
- Choose the appropriate workflow based on request type
- Follow test-first approach for features
- Load consolidated rules for bug fixes
- Reference individual rules only when deep technical detail is required
