# FEATURE DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW (Compact)

Compact activation to prevent bloat. For full workflow, see @Rules/Workflows/feature-development-workflow.md.

## ORDER
Database → Entities → Repository → Service → ViewModels → Controller → Views → Tests

## CHECK FIRST
- Reuse patterns: @Services/Interfaces/*, @Views/Shared/Components/*, @Constants/*
- Load only files for the current layer + immediate neighbors

## TEMPLATES
- Use @Rules/Templates/*.md for concrete code patterns

## TESTS
- Unit: service logic and validation
- Integration: controller RBAC, query happy-path
