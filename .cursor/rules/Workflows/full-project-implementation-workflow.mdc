High-level guardrails to minimize default context. Full details at @Rules/Workflows/full-project-implementation-workflow.md.

## PHASES
SETUP → INFRASTRUCTURE → CORE → FEATURES → TESTING → DEPLOYMENT

- Security and POPI redaction priority

## LOAD STRATEGY
- Phase-specific minimal files only (e.g., DI + current module)
